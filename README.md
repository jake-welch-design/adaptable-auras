# adaptable-auras
Final code used with my project Adaptable Auras as exhibited November 22, 2023

Adaptable Auras is an installation designed to explore & challenge the role technology plays in the tradition of art by implementing reproduction & machine learning technologies to create an art piece that is intrinsically connected to those who view it. The pen plotter receives data collected from individuals in the space using computer vision & converts that data into a unique drawing.

This installation was completed for my capstone project as part of my senior semester in the Multi-Disciplinary Design program at the University of Utah.

Special thanks to all who helped guide & support me throughout its development, I couldn't have done it with out all of you.
